A worker service project using .NET core that scrapes and stores 
company-wise stock price information from the website of Dhaka 
Stock Exchange Ltd. I have used HTML Agility Pack (HAP) to fetch 
HTML nodes from the webpage.
Entity Framework, Unit of Work pattern, and Repository Patterns have 
been used to store data in database tables.
